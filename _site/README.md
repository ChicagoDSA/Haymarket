A template to easily launch Chicago DSA websites.

[Cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) provided the source templates, and David Darnes wrote an immensely helpful [tutorial on setting up your own Jekyll themes](https://www.siteleaf.com/blog/making-your-first-jekyll-theme-part-1/). Color palettes and typography are from the [DSA National Design Committee](https://design.dsausa.org/).
