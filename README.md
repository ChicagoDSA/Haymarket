# Haymarket
A GitHub Pages theme to easily launch Chicago DSA websites.

[Cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) provided the source templates, and David Darnes wrote an immensely helpful [tutorial on setting up your own Jekyll themes](https://www.siteleaf.com/blog/making-your-first-jekyll-theme-part-1/). Color palettes and typography are from the [DSA National Design Committee](https://design.dsausa.org/).

### Getting started

1. Create your new repository, ```my-new-site```.
2. Navigate to the **Settings** tab of ```my-new-site``` and scroll down to **GitHub Pages**.
3. Under **Source**, select ```master```. Under **Theme Chooser**, select any theme.
4. Go to the root directory of ```my-new-site``` and open ```_config.yml```. Clear it out and add ```remote-theme: ChicagoDSA/Haymarket```.
5. Give it a few moments to build and refresh ```my-username.github.io/my-new-site/```.
6. Woohoo, your theme is working!
